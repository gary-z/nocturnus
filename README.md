# Nocturnus

An RPG passion project made with RPG Maker MV

## Getting started:

To begin, you need access to the game's assets (found in google drive)

1. Clone this project somewhere convenient
2. Copy all assets from the **NocturnusMV** folder of google drive into your cloned project folder. Your project folder should now contain the rpgproject file as well as folders named audio, fonts, img, icon, data and so on.
3. Rename **MapInfos-versioned.json** in the data folder to **MapInfos.json**.
